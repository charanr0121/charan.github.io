## Course Summary
In this weekly seminar course, New Media students were introduced to some familiar and some new faces in the industry. Speakers such as the Co-Founder of Offbeat Media Group, engineers from big tech companies, and many more graced the stage and gave us insight on their journey into the professional world and advice on how to succeed.

Throughout the semester, we were tasked with learning about our credit scores, personality types, and potential jobs in the future. The importance of credit isn't usualy taught in school, so I really appreciated these lessons and guidelines. As for my personality type, I was given ENFP. With this categorization, I found out valuable information about myself. For example, ENFP's work well with INTP. My brother is an INTP, so my plans to work with him on a business in the future seems more viable.
