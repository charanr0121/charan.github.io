# Rich Media Production
## Course Summary
Throughout this course, students got to learn about the basica of Swift and SwiftUI, culminating in a final project. I had worked with coding languages such as Java and Python before, so picking up Swift was just some syntax differences. The main takeaway from this course was my ability to develop [mobile apps](https://github.com/charanr0121/NMIX4310). For my final project, I used a third-party library called SwiftUI Charts and built a [COVID-19 tracker](https://github.com/charanr0121/Covid19SwiftApp).
