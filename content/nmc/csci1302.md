# Software Development in Java
## Course Summary
In this course, I learned the fundementals of Java programming with GUI libraries like JavaFX and APIs such as the iTunes Music API. Some of the projects included a Latin Squares Game, a GUI Calculator, an iTunes Media Browser, and a Snake and Sudoku game for the final.

Unfortunately, due to the UGA CS department policies, I am not able to showcase my work/code in a public repository, but nevertheless, it was a great experience getting to work with new technologies and building working interactive applications.
